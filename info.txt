install this all

react-router-dom
react-redux
react-moment
axios
react-router
react-typed
redux
redux-devtool-extension




I had the same issue. I fixed it by downgrading react-router and react-router-dom to version 5.2.0.

Just run npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0 and npm install react-router@5.2.0. This should fix the issue with withRouter().
